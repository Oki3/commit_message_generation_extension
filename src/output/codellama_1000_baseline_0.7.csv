======================================================================

This commit updates the `ExitSiteInfection` model by adding a new scope to the `has_many` association with `organism_codes`, which ensures that the associated `organism_codes` are unique. This is necessary because some of the associated `organism_codes` may not be unique, and this change ensures that the correct and unique `organism_codes` are used in all cases.

The changes made to the model include:

* Adding a new scope to the `has_many` association with `organism_codes`, which is called `-> { uniq }`. This scope filters out any duplicate entries in the associated `organism_codes`.
* Changing the `as` option of the `has_many` association with `infection_organisms` to `infectable`, as this is more descriptive of the relationship.

Update `ServerProperties` to enable context root redirect for Tomcat 7
=====================================================================

This commit updates the `ServerProperties` class to enable context root redirect for Tomcat 7. The update is necessary because the `setMapperContextRootRedirectEnabled()` method was only introduced in Tomcat 8, and earlier versions of the method are not supported by Tomcat 7. The update is done using a try-catch block to handle the exception thrown when trying to call the method on a Tomcat 7 server."

Update save-field-ng directive to support destroy event of the scope
--------------------------------------------------------------

The changes in this commit aim to add support for the `$destroy` event of the AngularJS scope, which is triggered when the scope is being destroyed. This allows us to reset the initial value of the field if it was changed and the user navigates away from the page or closes the tab without saving the changes.

The implementation involves adding a new listener for the `$destroy` event on the `scope` object, which will be triggered when the scope is destroyed. In this listener, we check whether the `iAttrs.value` attribute exists and if it does, we assign the initial value to that attribute using the `$parse` service. This ensures that any changes made to the field are discarded when the user navigates away from the page or closes the tab without saving the changes.

This commit also adds a new line of code in the `controller` function, which is responsible for setting up the `onSave` callback. The `onSave` callback will be triggered whenever the user attempts to save the changes made to the field. In this implementation, we are not using the `onSave` callback yet, but it will be used in future commits to handle the saving of the changes made to the field."

---------------------------------------------

In this diff, we added a new method `getFeaturesObject` to the `FeatureCache` class in the OpenLayers library. This method allows us to retrieve features from the cache that match a given filter, which can be useful for improving performance when working with large datasets.

The implementation of this method involves using an R-tree data structure to store and query feature geometries. We also added a new property `geometryTypeIndex_` to the `FeatureCache` class, which is used to keep track of the geometry types of features in the cache. This allows us to use the type information when querying the cache, which can further improve performance.

Overall, this change improves the performance of feature caching by allowing us to more efficiently retrieve and filter features from the cache."

The simple printer is a new feature that allows users to view the health of the etcd endpoints in real-time. It displays information about each endpoint, including its IP address, whether it is healthy or unhealthy, and how long it took to respond to a proposal. The printer also provides a list of all endpoints and their corresponding health statuses.

This change was implemented to provide users with a simple and easy-to-use way to monitor the health of their etcd clusters in real-time. The new feature is accessible through the `etcdctl` command line tool, which allows users to view the health of their endpoints using the `endpoint health` command.

The `simplePrinter` struct was added to handle the logic for displaying endpoint health information. It takes a list of `epHealth` structs as input and displays the corresponding information for each endpoint in a formatted way. The `print` method was also modified to use the new `simplePrinter` struct instead of the original printer.

Overall, this change provides users with a more user-friendly and informative way to monitor the health of their etcd clusters."

* Updated the `buildRef` function to handle references with source fields, such as `ref_id`, and added a new `console.error` statement to log an error if a filter is applied on an unknown field.
* Refactored the code to use destructuring and improved readability by extracting common functionality into reusable functions.

it.","Update commit class to support new Grit version
=============================================

This commit updates the `Commit` class to support the new Grit version, including the ability to parse multiple parents and encoding information. The changes are implemented in the following ways:

* Add support for parsing multiple parents by updating the `parents` attribute to store an array of parent commit hashes instead of a single hash.
* Add support for parsing encoding information by updating the `encoding` attribute to store the encoding used for the commit message and author information.
* Update the `actor` method to handle both the author and committer information by parsing the `author` and `committer` lines separately and storing them in separate attributes.

This change is intended to improve the compatibility of the `Commit` class with newer versions of Grit, while still maintaining backwards compatibility with older versions."

Update CurrencyLoader to filter out empty currency values
=======================================================

This commit updates the `CurrencyLoader` class to filter out empty currency values from the `$currencies` array before returning it. This is done by using the `array_filter()` function to remove any elements that are not strings, and then using the `array_unique()` function to ensure that only unique values remain in the array. Finally, the `sort()` function is used to sort the remaining values alphabetically.

The change was made to improve the performance of the `getCurrencies()` method by reducing the number of empty currency values that are returned. This can be useful for applications where the list of currencies is displayed in a dropdown menu or similar widget, and it is important to only display valid options."

The new method, `pause`, allows the execution of the memcached client to be paused and resumed at will, making it easier to work with asynchronous code. The method takes no arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether the pause was successful or not.

This change also adds support for the `multi` command, which allows multiple commands to be executed in one call. This makes it easier to perform batch operations on the memcached client.

The new methods are implemented using the `Fiber` class from the Ruby standard library, which provides a way to pause and resume the execution of a thread or fiber. By using fibers, we can ensure that the memcached client is always ready to accept new commands and handle them asynchronously."

Created by MOE: <URL>","[FEATURE] Add support for a new JavaScript feature: Destructuring assignment

The goal of this change is to add support for destructuring assignment, which allows developers to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to multiple variables in one step. This feature improves the readability and conciseness of code by allowing developers to perform complex data manipulation operations with fewer lines of code.

To implement this feature, we will need to make changes to the JavaScript parser and compiler, as well as add new tests to ensure that the new syntax is handled correctly. Additionally, we will need to update the documentation to explain how to use the new feature and its benefits.

The commit message for this change would be:

In line 63, the original code checks if the `class_name` variable is nil and whether a block has been provided. If both conditions are met, it creates a new class name by concatenating the base Java class name with the source descriptor and the file type.

In lines 74-81, the modified code adds an additional check to ensure that the `class_name` variable is not nil before assigning it a value. If the variable is still nil after this check, it either uses the base Java class name or assigns a default value based on whether a block has been provided.

Overall, these changes improve the robustness of the code by preventing unexpected errors and ensuring that the custom activity class is always properly initialized."

Update RPC server to handle errors more robustly

This commit updates the RPC server to handle errors more robustly by checking for EOF or unexpected EOF errors when reading the request body, and returning an error response if either of these conditions are met.

Additionally, this change makes the server more resilient to errors in incoming requests by returning a meaningful error message instead of silently closing the connection."

commit message:

Added quote_name method to query table information

In the original diff, we can see that a new line has been added in the query_table method. The added line is responsible for quoting the name of the table using the quote_name method.

This change is necessary because some database systems use a different syntax for quoting names than others. By adding this method, we ensure that the code will work correctly on all supported platforms.

The commit message clearly describes what changed and why, making it easier for other developers to understand the purpose of the change in the future.

In summary, the commit message provides a clear description of the change and its motivation, which helps to improve communication and collaboration among team members."

This commit adds a new test method to the `CollectionTest` class that tests the expected behavior when an element is not found in the collection. The test method asserts that the `get()` method throws a `\RuntimeException` with the message ""Element with key: 'page1.md' not found."" when the specified key does not exist in the collection. This test helps to ensure that the `get()` method behaves correctly and throws an exception when an element is not found, which can help prevent unexpected behavior in production code."

In this commit, we added support for saving the filename with a different extension than .ged. This allows users to save their files in other file formats, which can be useful if they need to work with specific software or hardware that cannot read .ged files.

The change was made by updating the case statement in the addmedia function to check for the presence of an extension in the filename and then save the file with a different extension if it is present. The code also handles the case where the user does not specify an extension, in which case the original .ged extension is used.

Overall, this commit adds a new feature to the program that allows users to save their files in other formats while still maintaining compatibility with existing functionality.

This commit adds support for parsing frontmatter in the `Page` class, which allows users to specify metadata for their pages using a specific syntax. This change introduces a new `frontmatter` property on the `Page` class that contains the parsed frontmatter data. The `frontmatter` property is an object that maps keys to values, and it can be used to retrieve the metadata defined in the frontmatter section of the page file.

The change also updates the existing `inferTitle` method to take into account the new frontmatter data when inferring the title for a page. This allows users to specify the title for their pages using the frontmatter syntax, which can be more convenient than manually specifying it in the configuration file.

Overall, this commit improves the functionality of the `Page` class by adding support for parsing and retrieving frontmatter data, and updating the `inferTitle` method to take into account this new information."

This commit updates the `copy` action to use resolved file paths instead of glob patterns when copying files from disk to the store. This is done by using `path.resolve()` to resolve any relative paths in the `fromGlob` pattern and then mapping the resulting array of resolved file paths to an array of absolute file paths.

This change is necessary because the `globby` library returns glob patterns instead of resolved file paths when using the `nodir` option, which can cause issues when copying files from disk to the store. By using absolute file paths, we ensure that the correct files are copied and that any relative path issues are avoided."

The changes in this commit update the `file` provider to support a new `backup` option. This option allows users to specify whether or not backups should be created when a file is updated.
