fixes #<I>","Refactor applyPolyfills function to include additional browser compatibility checks for customElements methods


The proposed commit message succinctly communicates the intent behind the changes made in `index.js`. It clarifies that adjustments were not only based on checking if `customElements` exists but also includes extra conditions related to certain polyfill features, such as 'closest', 'matches', and now explicitly mentions testing for a method like ‘getRootNode’ which was previously omitted from the checks in earlier versions of this code. The use of ""Refactor"" indicates that changes were made with an aim towards improving or updating existing functionality rather than introducing new features, aligning well within common Git commit practices where maintainability and clarity are key objectives for any modifications to be understood by other developers reviewing the history without further contexts."

Explanation: The changes made to the `reduce` function include replacing direct `__proto__` property access with a more robust approach using JavaScript's built-in `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` method, and also refining prototype object handling within nested reduceProperty functions for consistent treatment of both primitive values and methods (like 'value' or 'get').

Here's a detailed breakdown of the changes made, which justify this commit message: The diff indicates that additional lines were introduced between two nearly identical blocks (`@@ -1215,6 +1215,9`), specifically adding conditional logic to handle `drop_remainder` in dataset shuffling. This change aims to clarify the way data is prepared and partitioned for processing within TensorFlow pipelines by providing more granular control over whether or not elements are dropped when they don'thy fit into an even batch size, which can be important depending on how one wants their model training process managed (e.g., with regards to dropout effects).

Explangy reasoning for the change made in this single-sentence commit message is that within the provided code snippet, a line has been modified from using an existing method (`n += sanitize(html).length();`) to another one presumably more efficient or suitable given specific contexts and requirements of timing measurement—`sanitizeUsingPolicyBuilder(html).length()`. The change implies enhanced performance for this particular operation within the `Benchmark` class. Since we are not provided with additional details, such as what exactly each method does beyond length calculation (e.g., policy application specificity), and why there was a need to switch methods—the commit message stays focused on describing just that change: refactoring towards using Policy Builder for sanitization timing measurement within the Benchmark class implementation.

Explanation: The changes introduced a new import statement (`import multiprocessing`) at the beginning of the file, indicating that concurrent processing capabilities have been added (lines with ""+""). Additionally, several lines following this are related to initializing and utilizing these features within the logging system. This suggests an effort to handle log messages more efficiently across multiple processes. The existing try-except block has also adapted accordingly by introducing a multiprocessing lock (`_lock`) for synchronization purposes when writing logs from different contexts, indicating improved thread/process safety in concurrent environments (lines with ""+""). Lastly, the `_write` function now queues log messages and processes them within an acquired lock to ensure proper sequencing while allowing parallel collection of these tasks.

Former-commit-id: fea<I>bdefaf<I>e<I>e0aedb0ecffe6eff<I>","Refactor ngSaveField directive to handle $destroy event with initial value restoration logic using scope.$parent for uncontrolled inputs


Explanation of the generated commit message in detail: The changes introduced involve handling a specific lifecycle hook, `$destroy`, within an AngularJS controller. When this hook is triggered—indicating that the directive's associated element has been removed from the DOM and scope destruction sequence will occur soon afterward (e.g., during page reloads or when dynamically manipulating bindings)—the code now includes logic to restore initial values for uncontrolled inputs. This ensures a more robust state management, where even if directives are destroyed unexpectedly due to UI interactions like quick saves/aborts in an AngularJS form scenario (which is likely the context given), users' data will not be lost because of improper handling during scope destruction events. The specificity provided by `$parse(iAttrs.value).assign(scope.$parent, scope.initial)` means that if there are any initial values assigned to a bound attribute `value`, they get reassigned back into the parent's local storage upon cleanup of ngSaveField directive resources. This is deemed necessary for maintaining state integrity and improving user experience without requiring extensive refactorings across other components, making this change significant enough for its own commit message."

Explanation of the Commit Message:
The changes introduced in this particular Git diff involve adding new functionality into an existing Python module, specifically within the `TestLayer` class. The addition tests how images are randomly split using data from a predefined resource directory (e.g., Pascal dataset). This change is significant enough to warrant mentioning it as part of testing practices for image processing tasks and ensures that random splitting works correctly with proper initialization by setting up the path variable `resource_path`.

This summary captures the primary change made in this diff, where a conditional statement has been refactored from checking if visible directly (which is now deprecated) to using an existing and consistent boolean flag (`self.isvisible`). Additionally, there's note of improving how plugins get focused after being hidden or when they are not initially present on the screen by updating their refresh logic accordingly with a comment regarding future attention for this change in behavior. The summary avoids specific technical details while still conveying enough context about what was altered and why it may improve plugin management within Spyder'ish environment, as suggested by comments made during code changes (e.g., ""XXX Is it a good idea?"")."

Explanation of changes made by this commit includes simplifying the way we handle country currencies within our application; instead of using a separate method to filter out non-string items from an associative array before converting it into key/value pairs (which is now removed), and also replacing sorting with 'ksort' for better performance when dealing only with unique, sorted keys. The `array_filter` call has been entirely eliminated as the property `$currencies[$list]` already ensures its contents are strings due to earlier filtering logic that was simplified in this commit. This refactor aims at making our code cleaner and slightly more efficient by directly utilizing class properties instead of additional processing steps, which should streamline further operations on currency data within CurrencyLoader without impacting functionality or output results."

Explanation of the change made by this patch is that we have added a try-except block around two separate deletion processes (from `acl_users` and from member data) which now raise an informative customized error if any exceptions are caught due to issues like missing username. The original code did not handle these scenarios gracefully, potentially leading to unclear errors for the developers or maintainers of this module; by adding proper exception handling with specific messages we have made it clearer what went wrong in case something fails during deletion process and where exactly that failure occurred (missing user). This refactoring makes maintenance easier while also providing better feedback when issues arise."

This refactoring ensures uniformity in how the ViewsGenerator is initialized before testing commences. Previously redundant lines of code (`$this->activateModules();` followed by `$this->addTestData($testSuitePath);` without an immediate following `callService('ViewsGenerator');`) have been consolidated into a single, clear sequence that precedes the final dump of test-specific database state.
