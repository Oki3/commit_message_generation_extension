Former-commit-id: fea<I>bdefaf<I>e<I>e0aedb0ecffe6eff<I>","1. Add event listener for '$destroy' to clean up the value of 'value' attribute when directive is removed from the DOM.
        - This prevents any unexpected behavior if the component is reused elsewhere with the same 'value' attribute.
  2. Identify the issue with setting the value of 'value' attribute directly in the current implementation.
        - Bindings are already disabled by the time '$destroy' event is fired, so changing scope.value = ... has no effect.
        - We can't use scope.value.someField because we don't know anything about scope.value, it's passed from the outside.
  3. Consider using controllerAs to create an additional object layer (ctrl.value) for proper JS linking, but errorBubble only works with scope.
        - This would require a large refactoring of rgSaveField and other components.
  4. Implement a simple solution to handle the 'value' attribute cleaning in this specific component.
        - If 'value' attribute is provided, assign its parsed value to the parent scope at initialization.

f530054e1050f7f1d0cb77841aac6235aca4579b,domaincoder_code-metamodel-php,removed ArrayAccess from AbstractCollection,"1. Add a public method `count()` that returns the size of the collection.
        - This method will allow us to check if an offset is valid without having to iterate over the entire array.

   2. Modify the `offsetExists()` and `offsetGet()` methods to use the new `count()` method for size checking.
          - This will make the code more readable and consistent, as both methods now rely on the same function to get the collection's size.

   3. Remove the unused `$initial` variable from the `reduce_left()` function call in the `toArray()` method.
          - This variable was introduced in a previous commit but is no longer needed, as it is not being used anywhere in the function.

     (genepattern/static/resources/genepattern.navigation.js)

  2. Added two new lines to the file (new content is marked with '+')

  3. The changes are made in a function `init.wait_for_kernel`:
     - A new function `query_kernel()` has been introduced to check if the current kernel is Python, and if not, exit.
     - In case of a Python kernel, it calls the `Jupyter.notebook.kernel.kernel_info()` function to get the status of the notebook initialization.
       If the status is ""ok"", it calls another function `init.notebook_init_wrapper`.
     - If the status is not ""ok"", it sets a timeout of 500 milliseconds and recursively calls the `query_kernel()` function again.

[[ANSWER]]: Added check for Python kernel in `init.wait_for_kernel` function to prevent unnecessary execution when not using a Python kernel, and initiated notebook initialization upon successful connection to a Python kernel.","Added check for Python kernel in `init.wait_for_kernel` function to prevent unnecessary execution when not using a Python kernel, and initiated notebook initialization upon successful connection to a Python kernel."

    Previously, only single-valued fields could be validated with user-defined methods.

  2. Changed the line where the validation method is called to check if the input field exists before executing it.
    This ensures that an undefined index error does not occur when a specified field does not exist in the input array.

  3. Fixed a logic issue with the validation error handling by moving the validation call inside the isset() check for the input field.
    This corrects the previous implementation where the validation method was called even if the input field did not exist in the array, causing undefined index errors.

4. Updated the validation error structure to include the input value when setting the error in the $this->errors array.

cab8e6d8e2b44369c3e6e77393781275069f65f5,PRIArobotics_HedgehogClient,make _EventHandler a context manager,"1. Added context manager support to EventHandler class:
     - `__enter__` method is added to spawn the backend process on entry.
     - `__exit__` method is added to shutdown the backend process on exit.

  2. Refactored the spawning and shutting down of stdout_handler and stderr_handler within a context manager (with statement).

  3. Removed redundant calls to spawn for stdout_handler and stderr_handler as they are now handled within the context manager.

  4. Modified the try-finally block to use a with statement for handling stdout_handler and stderr_handler.

  5. The shutdown method is no longer called explicitly, as it is now called automatically when the context manager is exited.

  6. Updated the code structure to follow best practices and improve readability.

504f07c8a341f512b3267a446c89870f50f52ba5,HttpRunner_HttpRunner,fix: ensure_file_path_valid for folder path,"1. Identify the changes made in the code: The change is related to the function `ensure_file_path_valid` in the file `httprunner/utils.py`. The function now checks if a file name starts with a digit only after removing trailing separators (os.sep) from the raw file relative name before splitting it.

  2. Understand the context of the changes: This change improves the functionality of the `ensure_file_path_valid` function by handling file names that have leading digits, but where the leading digit is preceded by other characters (like dots or underscores). Previously, such file names would not be properly validated.

  3. Write a descriptive commit message: Refactor ensure_file_path_valid function to handle file names with leading digits before separator

  2. Understand the impact of the change: The change removes the explicit specification of the file type when creating a new file, relying on the default behavior instead. This could potentially affect how new files are handled in cases where specific file types (such as sockets or FIFOs) need to be created.

  3. Write a concise and descriptive commit message: Since the change affects the creation of new files, it would make sense to mention that in the commit message. A possible commit message for this change could be: ""Removed explicit file type specification when creating new files (defaulting to regular files)"".

  2. Add an if-statement checking for the existence of the composer.json file

Add a new method for the HotspotRenderer prototype, `blur_`, which sets the scale of the hotspot back to its original size (`NORMAL_SCALE`). This is performed using Tween.js animation similar to the `focus_` method.
        - This change allows the hotspot to be scaled back down when it loses focus.

  2. Add a conditional check in the newly created `blur_` method, where if the `timeForHospotClick` variable (which will be set later) exists, clear the timeout associated with it.
        - This ensures that no click event is emitted unintentionally when blurring the hotspot.

  3. Add a new method for the HotspotRenderer prototype, `down_`, which initiates the `blur_` function on an id passed as an argument. Also, this method sets a timer using setTimeout() for 1200ms (or 1.2 seconds), which will later emit a click event with the given id in case VR mode is active and the user has been looking at the hotspot for more than 1.2 seconds.
