Update save-field-ng directive to support destroy event of the scope
--------------------------------------------------------------

The changes in this commit aim to add support for the `$destroy` event of the AngularJS scope, which is triggered when the scope is being destroyed. This allows us to reset the initial value of the field if it was changed and the user navigates away from the page or closes the tab without saving the changes.

The implementation involves adding a new listener for the `$destroy` event on the `scope` object, which will be triggered when the scope is destroyed. In this listener, we check whether the `iAttrs.value` attribute exists and if it does, we assign the initial value to that attribute using the `$parse` service. This ensures that any changes made to the field are discarded when the user navigates away from the page or closes the tab without saving the changes.

This commit also adds a new line of code in the `controller` function, which is responsible for setting up the `onSave` callback. The `onSave` callback will be triggered whenever the user attempts to save the changes made to the field. In this implementation, we are not using the `onSave` callback yet, but it will be used in future commits to handle the saving of the changes made to the field.",Update save-field-ng directive to support destroy event of the scope

---------------------------------------------

In this diff, we added a new method `getFeaturesObject` to the `FeatureCache` class in the OpenLayers library. This method allows us to retrieve features from the cache that match a given filter, which can be useful for improving performance when working with large datasets.

The implementation of this method involves using an R-tree data structure to store and query feature geometries. We also added a new property `geometryTypeIndex_` to the `FeatureCache` class, which is used to keep track of the geometry types of features in the cache. This allows us to use the type information when querying the cache, which can further improve performance.

refactor(SVGParser): simplify parseColourComponent()

Parse a colour component value (0..255 or 0%-100%)

* Spec says components can be <integer> or <number>%.
* For simplicity, we will allow <number> for both.
* CSS rules say that only percent values should be clamped, but we will do it for both.

Explanation:
The commit message describes the changes made to the SVGParser class and why they were made. It includes a brief summary of what changed (a colour component value is simplified) and the reasons behind the change (the new implementation allows <integer> or <number>%, which is more flexible and easier to maintain). The commit message also mentions that the changes are in the `parseColourComponent()` method, which makes it easy for other developers to understand the scope of the changes.",refactor(SVGParser): simplify parseColourComponent()

The simple printer is a new feature that allows users to view the health of the etcd endpoints in real-time.

The printer also provides a list of all endpoints and their corresponding health statuses.

This change was implemented to provide users with a simple and easy-to-use way to monitor the health of their etcd clusters in real-time. The new feature is accessible through the `etcdctl` command line tool, which allows users to view the health of their endpoints using the `endpoint health` command.

The `simplePrinter` struct was added to handle the logic for displaying endpoint health information. It takes a list of `epHealth` structs as input and displays the corresponding information for each endpoint in a formatted way. The `print` method was also modified to use the new `simplePrinter` struct instead of the original printer.

This commit updates the `Commit` class to support the new Grit version, including the ability to parse multiple parents and encoding information. The changes are implemented in the following ways:

* Add support for parsing multiple parents by updating the `parents` attribute to store an array of parent commit hashes instead of a single hash.
* Add support for parsing encoding information by updating the `encoding` attribute to store the encoding used for the commit message and author information.
* Update the `actor` method to handle both the author and committer information by parsing the `author` and `committer` lines separately and storing them in separate attributes.

Update CurrencyLoader to filter out empty currency values
=======================================================

This commit updates the `CurrencyLoader` class to filter out empty currency values from the `$currencies` array before returning it. This is done by using the `array_filter()` function to remove any elements that are not strings, and then using the `array_unique()` function to ensure that only unique values remain in the array. Finally, the `sort()` function is used to sort the remaining values alphabetically.

The change was made to improve the performance of the `getCurrencies()` method by reducing the number of empty currency values that are returned. This can be useful for applications where the list of currencies is displayed in a dropdown menu or similar widget, and it is important to only display valid options.",Update CurrencyLoader to filter out empty currency values

Created by MOE: <URL>","[FEATURE] Add support for a new JavaScript feature: Destructuring assignment

The goal of this change is to add support for destructuring assignment, which allows developers to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to multiple variables in one step. This feature improves the readability and conciseness of code by allowing developers to perform complex data manipulation operations with fewer lines of code.

To implement this feature, we will need to make changes to the JavaScript parser and compiler, as well as add new tests to ensure that the new syntax is handled correctly. Additionally, we will need to update the documentation to explain how to use the new feature and its benefits.

This commit message describes the changes made to the file `assets/src/ruboto/activity.rb`. Specifically, it modifies lines 63-73 and adds lines 74-81. The modifications are related to creating a custom activity class in the Ruboto framework.

In line 63, the original code checks if the `class_name` variable is nil and whether a block has been provided. If both conditions are met, it creates a new class name by concatenating the base Java class name with the source descriptor and the file type.

In lines 74-81, the modified code adds an additional check to ensure that the `class_name` variable is not nil before assigning it a value. If the variable is still nil after this check, it either uses the base Java class name or assigns a default value based on whether a block has been provided.

Overall, these changes improve the robustness of the code by preventing unexpected errors and ensuring that the custom activity class is always properly initialized.","diff --git a/assets/src/ruboto/activity.rb b/assets/src/ruboto/activity.rb"

The update includes a new `coroutine` decorator that automatically calls the `next()` method on the internal generator function, making it easier to use asyncio with doxypypy.

Update build beta details to include autoNotifyEnabled if provided

This commit updates the `build_beta_details` of a build to include the `autoNotifyEnabled` attribute, if it is provided in the information hash. This is necessary because the `build_beta_detail` object does not have this information by default, and it can be useful for users to enable or disable notifications for their testers.

* Add meta data to provider options in LeafletTorqueLayer constructor

This commit adds the meta data from the model to the provider options. This is necessary because the Torque layer needs access to this information to properly render the tiles. The code uses a setTimeout function to defer the execution of this step, as it would otherwise cause an infinite loop where the keys in changedAttributes are constantly updated and the model is constantly being updated.",* Add meta data to provider options in LeafletTorqueLayer constructor

This commit updates the `copy` action to use resolved file paths instead of glob patterns when copying files from disk to the store. This is done by using `path.resolve()` to resolve any relative paths in the `fromGlob` pattern and then mapping the resulting array of resolved file paths to an array of absolute file paths.

This change is necessary because the `globby` library returns glob patterns instead of resolved file paths when using the `nodir` option, which can cause issues when copying files from disk to the store. By using absolute file paths, we ensure that the correct files are copied and that any relative path issues are avoided.",Update `copy` action to use resolved file paths for globbed files

===========================================

The changes in this commit update the `file` provider to support a new `backup` option. This option allows users to specify whether or not backups should be created when a file is updated. If set to `true`, Chef will create a backup of the file before updating it. If set to an integer greater than 0, Chef will create a backup with that many revisions.

This change was made to allow users more control over how their files are backed up and to improve the overall user experience. The `backup` option can be used in conjunction with other options like `create_if_missing` and `replace_only`.",Update file provider to support backup option
