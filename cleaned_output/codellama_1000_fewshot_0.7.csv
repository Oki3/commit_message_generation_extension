Added profile route to UserController to allow users to access their profiles

In this commit, we added a new route for accessing user profiles in the UserController class. This is an important feature that allows users to view and manage their own profiles on the platform. The commit includes changes to the routes file, the controller class, and the views folder.

To make this change, we updated the routes file to include a new route for accessing user profiles. We also updated the UserController class to include a new method that handles the request for profile access. Additionally, we created a new view file in the views folder to display the profile information.

[/INST: ](50) Allow plugin resources to be loaded by a special servlet

In this commit, we are adding support for loading plugin resources from a special servlet. This is an important change because it allows us to load additional resources that may not have been available before, making the application more flexible and robust.

The changes in this commit include adding a new method to the `ResourceServlet` class that allows for the loading of plugin resources. We also added some additional logic to handle the caching of resources, including setting the `Last-Modified` header and expiring the cache after one minute.

This commit message describes the changes made to the `Job` class in the `Katello::Candlepin` module. It adds a new constant called `NOT_FINISHED_STATES`, which is an array of strings that represent the states of a job that are not yet finished. The constant was added to the class level, so it can be accessed from any instance of the `Job` class.

The changes made in this commit are:

* Adding a new constant called `NOT_FINISHED_STATES`.
* Changing the definition of the `not_finished?` method to use the new constant.

[Sass] Improve error reporting for invalid SCSS syntax

In this commit, I improved the error reporting for invalid SCSS syntax in the `tok!` method of the `Sass::SCSS::Parser`. The previous implementation would only display a generic ""expected token"" message when an unexpected token was encountered. This message could be confusing to developers who are not familiar with the Sass language, as it did not provide any information about what exactly was expected.

To address this issue, I updated the `tok!` method to use a more descriptive error message that includes the name of the token that was expected. This message is derived from the `TOK_NAMES` hash, which maps regexes used in the parser to human-readable names of tokens. If the expected token cannot be found in this hash (which should never happen), I fall back to using the regular expression's source as a string and inspecting it for plain characters. This approach allows me to display a more informative message while still being compatible with all possible regexes.

Overall, this commit improves the error reporting in the Sass parser, making it easier for developers to understand what went wrong when they encounter invalid SCSS syntax.

Note: I did not include issue numbers or pull requests in the commit message as there are no associated issues or pull requests with this change.","[Sass] Improve error reporting for invalid SCSS syntax"

Added support for aborting RPC calls with setTimeout()
---------------------------------------------------------

In this commit, we added support for aborting RPC calls using `setTimeout()` in addition to the existing `abort()` method. This change was made to improve the usability of our library and provide more flexibility for users who need to manage their RPC requests.

The new `setTimeout()` method allows users to set a timeout for an RPC call, after which the request will be automatically aborted if it has not yet completed. This feature is particularly useful in situations where the user needs to ensure that an RPC call completes within a certain time frame.

Additionally, we updated the `abort()` method to also clear any existing timeouts for the RPC call, ensuring that the request can be aborted and cleaned up correctly.

Overall, this commit improves the functionality of our library by adding a new method for managing RPC calls in more detail.",Added support for aborting RPC calls with setTimeout()

Additionally, we have modified the `Args` field in the `VerifyRequest` struct to accept a slice of strings instead of a single string. This allows us to append multiple Pact files to the list of arguments passed to the verification command.

==================================================================

I have updated the `VariableScopeImpl` class to use an unmodifiable map for the `variableInstances` field. This is done by calling the `ensureVariableInstancesInitialized()` method before accessing the map, and then returning a copy of the map using the `Collections.unmodifiableMap()` method. This ensures that the variable instances are not modified outside of the class, while still allowing for read-only access to them from outside.

Allow atomic removal of 0 values from AtomicLongMap

This commit adds a new method `removeIfZero` to `AtomicLongMap`, which allows removing elements with a value of zero in an atomic manner.

The implementation is based on the existing `remove` method, but it uses a more efficient approach that only removes elements with a value of zero.

This commit is significant because it adds a new API to `AtomicLongMap` that allows for efficient removal of 0 values, which can be useful in certain performance-critical scenarios.

01555a0fe3112b3c7628ddcf8ba7911fffc5d97d,intel-analytics_BigDL,Add transformer doc and some fix (#<I>)," Add support for mat_to_floats_no_share transformer in test_image.py

In this commit, we have added a new test method `test_mat_to_floats_no_share` to the `TestLayer` class in `python/dllib/test/bigdl/transform/test_image.py`. This method tests the behavior of the `MatToFloats` transformer when `share_buffer=False`.

This commit is an extension of the previous commit that added support for the `MatToTensor` transformer in the same file. The reason for adding this new test method is to ensure that the `MatToFloats` transformer works correctly when `share_buffer` is set to `False`, which was not tested in the previous commit.

This commit also includes two new test methods, `test_empty_get_predict_local` and `test_empty_get_predict_distributed`, that test the behavior of the `ImageFrame.get_predict()` method when called on an empty image frame with a local and distributed Spark context, respectively. These tests are included to ensure that the `ImageFrame.get_predict()` method works correctly when no predictions have been made yet and with different types of Spark contexts.

Overall, this commit adds support for the `MatToFloats` transformer and includes new tests to ensure that it works correctly in various scenarios.",Add support for mat_to_floats_no_share transformer in test_image.py

This commit adds a new method to the RichFuture class called work, which is a workaround for the deadlock bug present in concurrent-ruby. This bug causes a deadlock when two threads try to access the same resource at the same time. The work method is a wrapper around the task execution code and ensures that only one thread can execute the task at a time, preventing the deadlock from occurring.

This commit also updates the Command#get method to call the new work method instead of directly calling the task. This is necessary because the task may be executed concurrently by multiple threads, which could cause the deadlock bug to occur if not properly handled.

Commit Message: Update Linux NFQueue implementation to use netlink-go's nfqueue package for better performance and compatibility with newer kernel versions.

The previous commit message ""Fixed: support linux with nfq (#269)"" was focused on a specific issue with the Linux NFQueue implementation, so this commit message should build upon that by addressing a more general issue related to performance and compatibility. The use of the word ""Update"" also helps convey that this is not a new fix, but rather an improvement over existing code.

The new Git diff introduces changes to the `enforcer/nfq_linux.go` file, specifically changing the import statement from `github.com/aporeto-inc/nfqueue-go` to `github.com/aporeto-inc/netlink-go/nfqueue`, which represents a more modern and efficient way of interacting with NFQueue on Linux systems. This change is significant, as it will improve the performance and compatibility of the code with newer kernel versions that may have different requirements or limitations compared to older kernels.

Overall, this commit message should provide context for the changes in the `enforcer/nfq_linux.go` file, while also highlighting the benefits of the new implementation and its importance as a more modern and efficient approach.","The previous commit message ""Fixed: support linux with nfq (#269)"" was focused on a specific issue with the Linux NFQueue implementation, so this commit message should build upon that by addressing a more general issue related to performance and compatibility.

Add support for registering panels from external plugins

This commit adds support for registering panels from external plugins in the horizon dashboard. Previously, only panels defined in the core horizon application were able to be registered with the dashboard. This change allows users to define and add their own custom panels to the dashboard through the use of plugin configuration files.

The changes made to the `horizon/base.py` file include adding a new method for registering panels, as well as updating the `Site` class to handle the addition of external panel groups. Additionally, the `panels` attribute of the `PanelGroup` class has been updated to store a list of registered panel slugs rather than the full classes themselves.

Overall, this commit improves the extensibility and customizability of the horizon dashboard by allowing users to define and add their own custom panels.",Add support for registering panels from external plugins

Refactor: rename parseFile() to parse() and process() to setFile()

Previously, there were two functions with similar names that served different purposes. The first function, `parse()`, was responsible for parsing an INI file and returning its contents as an array. The second function, `process()`, was used to set the INI file path to be parsed by the parser object.

In this commit, we have renamed both functions to make their purpose more clear and consistent with the existing codebase. We have also added a new method, `setFile()`, which allows users to set the INI file path to be parsed by the parser object. This change makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

[rpc] Fix handling of unexpected EOF errors in serve()

This commit fixes an issue where the server would crash when encountering an unexpected EOF while reading the request body. This was happening due to a misunderstanding of the io.EOF and io.ErrUnexpectedEOF errors, which are both used to indicate that the reader is at the end of the input stream.

In this commit, we add a new condition to check for EOF before calling csrv.codec.ReadRequestBody(). If the error is EOF, we return nil and let the server continue running. If the error is ErrUnexpectedEOF, we return the error to the caller so that they can handle it appropriately.

This change improves the stability of the server by preventing it from crashing due to unexpected EOF errors, while still providing a meaningful response to the client in case of an issue with the request parameters.",[rpc] Fix handling of unexpected EOF errors in serve()

Update GitCommitList widget to fix tab traversal issue on IE and Firefox

This commit updates the GitCommitList widget to fix a tab traversal issue that was previously present in both Internet Explorer and Firefox. The issue was caused by the widget's use of `setTimeout` to check for the active element, but this approach had a delay that caused the tab key to not work correctly on some browsers.

The updated code uses a 10ms delay instead of the previous 0ms delay, which should fix the issue and make the tab traversal more consistent across all browsers.

Implement ReadMemInfo on FreeBSD
-------------------------------

This commit adds support for reading system memory information on FreeBSD systems. The changes are made in `pkg/system/meminfo_freebsd.go`. The code is updated to use the new `syscall` package to read from `/proc/meminfo`, and a new error message is returned if any of the required fields are missing or negative.

The motivation for this change is to improve the accuracy of the system memory information reported by Vector, especially on FreeBSD systems where the traditional methods of reading memory usage may not be accurate.
